BATTLE OF NEIGHBOURHOODS - WEEK 4 - PART 1:

THE BACKGROUND:

Madrid is a municipality and a city in Spain.
The associated metropolitan area has a population of 6,507,184 inhabitants,
so it is the second in the European Union, after Paris,
and also the second most populated city in the European Union, only behind Berlin.


The gastronomy of Madrid is the set of traditional dishes of the Spanish capital. 
It has the culinary traditions of the initial population when Philip II created the capital, 
and later from the villages of his own province that contributed their food to the 
own kitchen of the city of Madrid. It is common to see how the typical smell of Madrid's cuisine 
is that of frying in vegetable oil: the churros (made in the churrerias), the calamari a la 
Roman, the potato omelette, the squid sandwiches served in the bars, the patatas bravas, 
the chopitos, etc. Bars and restaurants give off this smell on the streets to almost any 
time of day. According to some authors, Madrid is a kitchen that is the result of the haste of the tascas and figones, 
of dishes elaborated quickly and showing flavors to be accompanied with wines of the region.
Many of the dishes that have the denomination "a la madrileña" originate from the tascas and 
Madrilenian taverns.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Imagine that a citizen named José, from Mexico, comes to Madrid
for the first time, to spend a vacation for 3 months.
Jose likes to lead a healthy life and therefore he does sports often.
He also likes to try the gastronomy of each country, but he never wants to leave the
food from his home country in his travels, which he says is "the best in the world".
Therefore, being in a new country and continent, you have no idea, which places or 
what environments you might like more or less.
Therefore, we should know which places could be better adapted to your tastes, 
according to the evaluations that exist of those places or those that have
more valued or more traveled (or less, if you are a person who does not like
agglomerations). Therefore, we could ask the following questions,
which can already be intuited from the above:

Are there Mexican restaurants in Madrid?
Which gyms are more highly rated (because the higher the rating, the more
in many occasions, that he is better qualified and therefore, he will be able to train 
better)
Which parks are the least traveled (because of the pandemic, it is more
convenient, running in parks where there are not many people)

THE TARGET OF THIS PROJECT:

It is aimed at those people who like to try the cuisine of other countries and
is also aimed at those people who have a "nationalistic streak", and although
find elsewhere, want to maintain a diet that reminds them of their 
place of origin.
It would also be oriented to those people who like to lead a healthy life
and like to take care of themselves physically.

WHAT THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ACHIEVE:

Is to make visible the typical restaurants of Madrid (since the gastronomic tourism,
can make the difference between returning to a country to visit or not) and those Mexican restaurants in 
particular, since it could be that the need that Jose has, could have more Mexicans that come to Spain or others 
types of tourists who are interested in trying these types of foods, since in their countries
whether or not such restaurants are difficult or do not exist.
